My friend and I basically made an app that uses AI to pair people together. An incredibly large part of your success in this world is determined not by what you can do, but by who you know. Who would Steve Jobs have been without Steve Wozniak? Yet I don't think that same kind of relationship can be cultivated at a networking event, where people just go to "meet people." It arises out of spontaniety. Out of the random situations that life thrusts you in that allows you to develop close bonds with those that you love. The deep conversations after a hike on a sunday afternoon. Drinking a cup of hot chocalate while sitting in the warm cozy room of someone elses living room, listening to their latest product pitch. These are the types of experiences we're trying to cultivate. Ones that lead to profound and beautiful world change, not piles of business cards. 

## Technicalities
